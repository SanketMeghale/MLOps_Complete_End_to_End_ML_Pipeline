This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for Spam Detection, covering the complete machine learning lifecycle from data ingestion to experiment tracking, with cloud-based artifact storage.

The project is designed to showcase industry-standard MLOps practices using DVC, DVCLive, and AWS S3 for data versioning, experiment tracking, and reproducibility.




## Project Description

Spam detection is a binary classification problem where messages are classified as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

This project focuses on building a reproducible, scalable, and cloud-enabled machine learning pipeline rather than only achieving high model accuracy.

The main objectives of this project are:
- Build a modular end-to-end ML pipeline
- Track experiments and metrics using DVCLive
- Version datasets and models using DVC
- Store artifacts remotely using AWS S3
- Ensure reproducibility across different environments

## ML Pipeline Workflow

1. Data Ingestion  
   - Load raw spam dataset  
   - Store and version the dataset using DVC  

2. Data Validation  
   - Check missing values  
   - Validate schema and class distribution  

3. Data Transformation  
   - Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)  
   - Tokenization and stopword removal  
   - Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer  

4. Model Training  
   - Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression  
   - Hyperparameters are controlled via params.yaml  

5. Model Evaluation  
   - Evaluate the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
   - Track metrics using DVCLive  



## Experiment Tracking

This project uses DVCLive for experiment tracking.

Tracked items include:
- Training and validation metrics
- Model performance across different experiments
- Logs and plots for comparison

All experiment-related artifacts are stored inside the dvclive directory.



## AWS Integration (DVC Remote Storage)

AWS S3 is used as a remote storage backend for DVC to store:
- Versioned datasets
- Trained models
- Intermediate pipeline artifacts

This enables scalable, durable, and cloud-based artifact management.

Example DVC remote configuration:

dvc remote add -d s3remote s3://<your-bucket-name>/dvc-store  
dvc push  

To retrieve data and models:
dvc pull  



## Parameter Management

All model and training parameters are centralized in the params.yaml file.

Example parameters include:
- Model type
- Hyperparameters
- Random state

This allows easy experiment tuning and clean versioning of parameters.



## Reproducibility

The project ensures full reproducibility using:
- dvc.yaml for pipeline definition
- dvc.lock for exact pipeline versions
- params.yaml for parameter tracking
- AWS S3 for remote artifact storage

Running the following command will reproduce the entire pipeline:
dvc repro
